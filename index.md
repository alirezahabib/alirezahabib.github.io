# Hello ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Alireza Habibzadeh, a 4<sup>th</sup> year undergraduate student at Sharif University of Technology, studying computer engineering and physics.

I also had the incredible opportunity to contribute to research at the
[Laboratory of Photonic Integrated Circuits and Quantum Measurements (LPQM)](https://www.epfl.ch/labs/k-lab/){:target="_blank"}
at EPFL as a scientific intern under the supervision of
[Prof.&nbsp;Kippenberg](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=PRCbG2kAAAAJ){:target="_blank"}.

My work primarily focused on developing an automatic calibrator system for characterizing superconducting qubits, utilizing [Quantum Mahines&reg;](https://www.quantum-machines.co/){:target="_blank"} quantum controllers.

Beyond my academic pursuits, I have a wide range of interests. 
I'm a movie enthusiast you can find me [here on IMDb](https://www.imdb.com/user/ur56527251){:target="_blank"}. 
Spending quality time with friends, writing scripts, coding, and capturing moments through photography are my favorite pastimes.
